## Local Development
To run this app locally, clone the project (or download it as a zip and unzip it to a directory), navigate to the root directory with a command prompt or terminal (where the package.json file is located), and run npm install to download the necessary dependencies onto your local machine.

Inside the root directory, you can run some built-in commands:

```
npm start
```
Runs the app in development mode.

Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.

The page will automatically reload if you make changes to the code.

You will see the build errors and lint warnings in the console.

```
npm run build
```
Builds the app for production to the build folder.

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.

Your app is ready to be deployed.
